They had to name it that since no one could ever agree on who owned it. The Royal Empire says their colony of Mayfair was there first. But right across the bay, those Viking zealots from Valhalla established their colony of Njordheim. Then for the past century or two the island changed hands between Mayfair ruling Njordheim for one decade, then Njordheim ruling Mayfair for the next. It was all based on who was gettin beatin up on back in the Olden Worlde, the Royal Empire versus Valhalla.”<br><br>“This ‘ere camp, Bifröst, is kinda like X in that way. It was started by Valhalla as a prison camp. That’s why we got the Norse name and all. But in the last big war, the Royals won and Valhalla had to give up a bunch of their territories here in the New World. Of course, the Royals just wanted this place for our resources. Some of the old fellas here were Norse Transports, from back in the day, but most of us were Transported here by Her Majesty.”",

Some still call the whole big mess Njordheim or Mayfair, but that’s mostly just old-school Valhallans, or Empiricists. Most folks don’t want to ruffle those feathers, and just keep referring to the city the way it had always been marked on maps - with the letter X. In fact, in the last War of Piety, even though the Empire and Valhalla were on opposing sides, X stayed out of the fighting.”",

Even the Post and the New Foundland Company use a lot of Brawn. They all rely on strength and power. Now the downfall of brawn is that it isn’t flexible. Once Brawn commits to a course, there ain’t any turnin back, even if you realize it’s the wrong course. Brawn just isn’t flexible, but when power is needed, Brawn gets the job done.
