Back in the stern, there is a small hold. There are a few supplies stored here, including a few wheels of cheese, some bottles of water, and two oars for rowing. It seems that some others who were fleeing the shipwreck started to stow their possessions in this hold too, as there is a jacket, a couple bottles of fine brandy, and a crate of silverware. <br><br>You put on the jacket, as it will protect you from the sun. You consume a small amount of the cheese and water, but you will have to ration it out, since you have no idea how long it may take for you to be rescued, or find land. There is also a sealed metal chest, but you don't have any way of unlocking it here at sea. The other supplies might be good to hang on to for bartering with potential rescuers.",

Animals are a great example of Hand. Look at an octopod camouflaging with the coral in order to catch it’s prey, or a cat stealthily stalkin its prey. Hand is smart, and also sneaky. Some folks don’t rightfully trust Hand - and with good reason. Hand can be the strategy of the intelligent - it can also be the strategy of thieves.”<br><br>“Now, note that this time you’ll have two options. It’ll be easier to take out my Gladiator and Viking if you sacrifice your blue Cat, but if you play your next few moves right, your Dog can take them both out and still be safe himself. The Dog is riskier than the Cat, but usually with greater risk comes greater reward if you win. Greater loss if you lose though.”",

You find yourself in a clearing much like earlier in the day. This one again has a pile of flamingo food, but no flamingos. She begins making a noise that sounds like a pig chasing a sheep chasing a monkey. You feel ridiculous, but you try to join in with her, creating something much worse than anyone would normally experience in a barnyard. Sure enough though, two beautifully colored flamingos glide downward in the clearing and begin feeding on the bait. You switch sounds, approach with the comb, and are rewarded with a sack of loose feathers. Siobhan collects most of the feathers, but you still feel that you contributed in some small part. "

We have to do as Violet says,” says Pana. <br><br> “I trust the Widow least of the two. At least Skaarhart has the decency to be honest that she’ll have us all killed. From what I’ve heard of the Widow Violet, her treatment of us will be worse.” <br><br> “There’s a chance we could survive death or worse if we try bluffing our way out,” interjects Grumpy Convict Rainer. “They don’t know when our last shipment was, and that we’ve got four months of goods stockpiled. We tell them that since the Empire is running with their tail between their legs, a couple days ago an Imperial ship just took our entire inventory of feathers and eggs with them back to the Olden Worlde.",
