Perhaps it wasn’t wise to travel on a ship named the Medusa?<br><br>“Remain calm!” Orders someone who thinks they have control over the situation, just as the groaning deck tilts even more. Several of the bunks come unbolted from the floor, and slide across the room. <br><br>There is only one door to your cabin, and it is free of water. (for the time being)';
