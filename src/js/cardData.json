You see there is a small area at the bow where the front of the boat has an overhang. It is tight, but this could be a good place to shelter you from sun or rain while you sleep. In the stern, there is a small hold. There are a few supplies stored here, including a few wheels of cheese, some bottles of water, and two oars for rowing. It seems that some others who were fleeing the shipwreck started to stow their possessions in this hold too, as there is a jacket, a metal lockbox, a couple bottles of fine brandy, and a crate of silverware. <br><br>You put on the jacket, as it will protect you from the sun. You consume a small amount of the cheese and water, but you will have to ration it out, since you have no idea how long it may take for you to be rescued, or find land. The other supplies might be good to hang on to for bartering with potential rescuers.",

Since you’re new at this, I’ll let you know that she’s gonna mess you up in short order. But if you take her head on, my Gladiator will make short work of you. You’d be better off usin a more round-about strategy of takin out my Gladiator first, then my Viking. You need a more flexible piece that has less power, but longer range than the Viking, like your Cat or Dog. We call this a Hand move. Hand is sorta the opposite strategy of Brawn. Hand is flexible, nimble, dexterous, like an acrobat or a spy. Hand strategy turns your opponent’s power against themselves. Animals are a great example of Hand. Look at an octopod camouflagin with the coral in order to catch it’s prey, or a cat stealthily stalkin its prey. Hand is smart, and also sneaky. Some folks don’t rightfully trust Hand - and with good reason. Hand can be the strategy of the intelligent - it can also be the strategy of thieves.”<br><br>“Now, note that this time you’ll have two options. It’ll be easier to take out my Gladiator and Viking if you sacrifice your blue Cat, but if you play your next few moves right, your Dog can take them both out and still be safe himself.

The birds don’t do well in captivity though, so we just take care of em while they’re young and fragile so that we can have lots of productive adults flyin around in the wild.”<br><br>",
